    "1. The following code accesses the [lyrics.ovh](https://lyricsovh.docs.apiary.io/#reference/0/lyrics-of-a-song/search) public api, searches for the lyrics of a song, and stores it in a dictionary object.  Write the resulting json to a file (either a JSON file or a pickle file; you choose). You will read in the contents of this file for future questions so we do not need to frequently access the API."
